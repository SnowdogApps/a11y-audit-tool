## Application setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm install
```

### Development Server

#### Supabase instance

Steps to run project locally:

1. Run `npx supabase login` and pass generated access token
2. Run `npx supabase start`
3. Pass envs from supabase started setup to `.env` file:
  * `API URL` üëâ `SUPABASE_URL`
  * `anon key` üëâ `SUPABASE_KEY`
  * `service_role key` üëâ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`

Docs references: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development

#### Nuxt application

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Https configuration

**Install `mkcert` on your system**. The installation instructions for macOS, Windows and Linux can be found in the mkcert [Github repository](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert).

**Create a valid certificate by running the following command in your project folder:**
<pre>
mkcert [-install] localhost
</pre>

**Run your project using**
<pre>
npm run dev-secure
</pre>

Your project will now be served on https://localhost:3000.

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

## Application Supabase setup steps

1. Create [supabase](https://supabase.com/) (DB schema installation process described below) project or use existing one
2. Create `.env` file within exposed in `.env.example` variables, fill then with appropriate values before build/development run
3. Create user(s) in DB - auth service. Manage admin/user roles as described below

## Application DB setup

[Supabase](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects) projects rely on the [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) database engine. In the `./sql/` directory you will find all the sql installation files needed to make the whole application useful.

### Schema setup

To install the necessary schema, please go to the [SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/overview#the-sql-editor) tab of your project and `RUN` all sql lines in the order presented on directory and inner file level.

### Project public tables overview

#### Structure

1. `audits` table columns:

- `id`
- `created_at` (timestamp)
- `updated_at` (optional, timestamp)
- `profile_id` (references public.profiles)
- `project_id` (references public.projects)
- `status` (`draft` or `completed`)
- `report_type` (`review`, `functional` or `wcag`)
- `config` (optional, JSON data)
- `issues` (optional, JSON data)

2. `profiles` table columns:

- `id` (references auth.users)
- `updated_at` (optional, timestamp)
- `username` (optional, unique)
- `full_name` (optional)
- `avatar_url` (optional, feature not implemented)
- `user_type` (optional, `viewer` or `auditor`)

3. `projects` table columns:

- `id`
- `name` (text)
- `description` (optional)

4. `profile_project` table columns:

- `profile_id` (references public.profiles)
- `project_id` (references public.projects)

Primary key is on both columns `profile_id` and `project_id`

5. `axe` table columns:

- `id`
- `created_at` (timestamp)
- `audit_id` (references public.audits),
- `selector` (text)
- `size` (text)
- `results` (JSON data)

#### Policy rules (RLS) per table

1. `audits` - viewable for both `admin` and granted (added to `profile_project` table) users, **only** `user` with `auditor` role can insert audits and edit them while status is set to `draft`, only `admin` user can delete and update audits anytime
2. `profiles` - can be created and updated by both `user` and `admin`
3. `projects` - viewable for both `admin` and granted (added to `profile_project` table) users, only `admin` can insert/update projects
4. `profile_project` - viewable for anyone, only `admin` can insert/delete permissions
5. `axe` - viewable for anyone, only `admin` can delete results

### TypeScript db data types support

Generated types are stored in `types/supabase.ts` file. After any change in tables/columns structure please regenerate this file.

To regenerate types you need to:

- Install `npx supabase` package
- Run `npx supabase login` and authenticate yourself within [token](https://app.supabase.com/account/tokens)
- Run `npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id "PROJECT_REF_NAME_GOES_HERE" --schema public > types/supabase.ts`

To use then in app simply pass `Database` interface as expected generic type for client connections. Example:

```JavaScript
const supabaseClient = useSupabaseClient<Database>()
```

### Admin role

Role information is stored on the user custom claim level and can be found in `claims_admin` auth user's property.

Usage example with `supabase` client module:

1. Get information if user is `admin`:

- via supabase client sdk:

  ```JavaScript
  const { data: isAdmin } = await useSupabaseClient().rpc('is_claims_admin')
  ```

- via sql editor:
  ```sql
  select get_claims('PASS-HERE-SPECIFIC-USER-UUID-FROM-AUTH-TABLE');
  ```

2. Add `admin` role for specific user via sql editor:

```sql
select set_claim('PASS-HERE-SPECIFIC-USER-UUID-FROM-AUTH-TABLE', 'claims_admin', 'true');
```

:warning: You will need to log in again to see the changes.

### User role

:warning: Not specified by default. After change, you will need to log in again to see the changes.

Only the Admin can grant users with `user_role`.

When custom claim `user_role` is set/updated, the corresponding information in the `profiles` table (`user_type` column) is also updated.

#### User role setup

In app we recognize both `auditor` and `viewer` role. To setup then you need to update user's context. You can do it:

- via supabase client sdk:

  ```JavaScript
  const userRole = 'auditor' // or 'viewer'
  const { error } = await setClaim(id, 'user_role', userRole)
  ```

- via sql editor:
  ```sql
  select set_claim('PASS-HERE-SPECIFIC-USER-UUID-FROM-AUTH-TABLE', 'user_role', '"auditor"');
  ```

### Custom claims

Custom Claims are special attributes attached to a user that you can use to control access to portions of your application. You can find more information here: https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-custom-claims#faq
