## Key Features

* **Downloadable Reports**: Generate reports for easy reference and collaboration, facilitating improvement efforts.
* **Project Organization**: Group audits into projects for better organization and management of accessibility testing efforts.

## Why Choose A11y Audit Tool?

## Project setup

### Prerequisites
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed

### Supabase

1. Create a Supabase project [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects).
2. Supabase projects rely on the [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) database engine. In the `./sql` directory you will find all the SQL installation files needed to make the whole application work.
To install the necessary schema, please go to the [SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/overview#the-sql-editor) tab of your project and `RUN` all SQL lines in the order presented on directory and inner file level.
3. In your Supabase project go to `Project Settings -> API`. Create `.env` file, copy `.env.example` content and set values from Supabase settings:
  * `NITRO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` üëâ Project URL
  * `NITRO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY` üëâ `anon public`
  * `NITRO_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` üëâ `service_role secret`

  Alternatively, you can run Supabase locally:
  1. Run `npx supabase login` and pass generated access token.
  2. Run `npx supabase start`.
  3. Pass envs from supabase started setup to `.env` file.
  
  Learn more [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development).

### Nuxt

1. Run:
  ```bash
  pnpm install
  pnpm exec playwright install
  pnpm dev
  ```
2. Register new user on `/register` page.

### Admin Role
Admins possess privileges to:
  * Create a new project
  * Assign user to a project
  * Set user type
  * See, edit and remove any audit

Admins have access to extra information and features on `/admin` page.

Admin role information is stored on the user [custom claims](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-custom-claims#faq) level and can be found in `claims_admin` auth user's property.
To check user custom claims run the following query in Supabase [SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/overview#the-sql-editor):
```sql
select get_claims('PASS-HERE-SPECIFIC-USER-UUID-FROM-AUTH-TABLE');
```

To grant admin privileges to a user, follow these steps:
  1. Run the following query in Supabase [SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/overview#the-sql-editor):
        ```sql
        select set_claim('PASS-HERE-SPECIFIC-USER-UUID-FROM-AUTH-TABLE', 'claims_admin', 'true');
        ```
  2. Re-login to Nuxt application to see the change.

### User Types
The application supports 2 user types:
  1. Auditor - can perform the following actions in projects he is assigned to:
      * Create new audits
      * View and edit his audit drafts
      * View all completed audits (called reports)
  2. Viewer - can perform the following actions in projects he is assigned to:
      * View all completed audits (called reports)

User type information is stored on the user [custom claims](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-custom-claims#faq) level and can be found in `user_role` auth user's property. When custom claim `user_role` is set/updated, the corresponding information in the `profiles` table (`user_type` column) is also updated.

To grant auditor/viewer privileges to a user, follow these steps:
1. Log in to Nuxt application as admin user, go to `/admin` and `Update user type`.

    Alternatively, run the following query in Supabase [SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/overview#the-sql-editor).

    Auditor:
    ```sql
    select set_claim('PASS-HERE-SPECIFIC-USER-UUID-FROM-AUTH-TABLE', 'user_role', '"auditor"');
    ```
    Viewer:
    ```sql
    select set_claim('PASS-HERE-SPECIFIC-USER-UUID-FROM-AUTH-TABLE', 'user_role', '"viewer"');
    ```
2. The user should re-login to Nuxt application to see the change.

### Https Configuration

**Install `mkcert` on your system**. The installation instructions for macOS, Windows and Linux can be found in the mkcert [Github repository](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert).

**Create a valid certificate by running the following command in your project folder:**
<pre>
mkcert [-install] localhost
</pre>

**Run your project using**
<pre>
npm run dev-secure
</pre>

Your project will now be served on https://localhost:3000.
